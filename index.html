      <h2>simple</h2>
      <p>Ergonomic design allows for simple single handed use by the earring wearer or by another person lending a helping hand. Shape and size allows for easy access behind the ear.</p>

      <h2>consistent</h2>
      <p>Works with butterfly or two-loop style backs. Simply engage the prongs and then squeeze to remove the earring. If the back is not fully removed after the first squeeze, release and squeeze again.</p>

      <h2>painless</h2>
      <p>Allows the earring post to be pushed out of the earring back without applying any pressure to the ear lobe. The earring wearer will hardly feel a thing!</p>
