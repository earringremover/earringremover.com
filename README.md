## 🔒 Scope & Intent

This repository is intentionally limited to:
- Product marketing pages
- Informational content
- Outbound links (e.g. Amazon)

It does **not** include:
- Analytics
- Forms
- User tracking
- Backend services

This keeps the site easy to maintain and easy to transfer to a new owner if needed.
